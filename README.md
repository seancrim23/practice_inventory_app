# practice_inventory_app
This app will be a mock inventory system for a store. Users (employees) can log in and enter items into inventory. Employees can then search for items in the inventory and also "scan" (basically mock the IDs that would be on a scanned barcode) to get information about an item or also mark it as sold. Also employees can create reports about items sold on a specific day, how much has sold in a certain timespan, and other stuff when I think of more features.
